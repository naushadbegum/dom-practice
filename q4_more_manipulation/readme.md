# Q4 - More manipulation

We are going to do a number of manipulation here. Examine the HTML closely, and then
make the following changes. Write your code in `script.js` file in this folder.

Once ready, you can test if you are correct by typing the following in the terminal.

```
npm test q4
```

## The Questions

1. Select the first `<h1>` element in the list. Change it so that it now displays in green color.

2. Change the text of the first `<li class="finished">` to the string "Repay credit card debt"

3. Select the element `<li id="urgent">`, and give it a black coloured border that has a width of '2px'. Hint: Check the `border-color`
and the `border-width` css properties on a web page.

4. Change the first element with the class `emphasis` such that it is underlined (check out the text decoration css style online)

5. Select first element with `<p class='emphasis'>` and change its background color to orange,
 its font size to "32px" and its line height to be "24px". 

6. Select the `<span class="todo">` which is nested inside the `<li id="urgent">` and give
 it a background color of 'yellow'

7. Change the first `<h2>` element such that it contains another element `<span class="greetings">About Us</span>` instead.
