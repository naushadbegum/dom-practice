#q12 - Flying

The form is missing some essential attributes (like class, id, values etc.) that are needed for form processing.

Complete the following tasks

1. Complete the function extractFormInfo inside index.js. Extract out the first name, last name, ticket class and options. You have to change the HTML so that it has the attributes (like class, id, value, name) you need to accomplish this.

2. When the user press the "Place booking", display the user's choices inside `div#summary`

3. The pricing for the tickets are:

First class: $1200
Business class: $750
Economy class: $250

and each option when checked (the checkboxes, that is) is another $10.

Calculate and show inside `div#summary` the total cost the user has to pay.
