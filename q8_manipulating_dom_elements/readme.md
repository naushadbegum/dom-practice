# Q8 - Selecting Many Elements and Manipulation

Examine the HTML file, and perform the following manipulations:

1. Select all elements with the class `emphasis` and change their font family to 'Verdana'

2. Select all `<li class='finished'>` and put a strikethrough through them (google for
'css text decoration')

3. Select all the `<li class='todo'>` that are in `<ul id='low-priority'>` and
change their background color to blue

4. Select all elements with the class `alert` and change the font color to red.

## Testing
