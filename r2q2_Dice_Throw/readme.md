#10 - Dice Throw

There are two boxes, each with a number inside it.

Your task is: whenever the user clicks on the roll button, generate a random number between 1 to 6 for the left box, and another random number between 1 to 6 for the right box. Show the total of the two numbers in the <div> which has the text result in it.

1. Hint: Google Math.random() to see how to generate a random number.

2. Add in classes or id to the elements if it helps
