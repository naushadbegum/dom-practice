# Q6 - Counter

Here comes your first challenge at coding an interactive program!

**IMPORTANT**: Due to limitation of the testing platform, use `innerHTML` instead of `innerText`
whenever possible.

1. Add the `script.js` such that when the '+' button is clicked, the number inside
the box goes up by 1.

2. Add another button, with the label '-',  to the HTML such that when it is clicked, the number inside
the box goes down by 1.  **Make sure you place this button after the increment button**

3. Add another button, this time with the label "Reset",  that when it is clicked, it will
reset the number in the box to 0. **Make sure you place this as the last button**.

4. Make it such the user cannot reduce the number in the box to below 0, and cannot raise it above 10.

5. Challenge: Make it such that when the number in the box is even, the background color of the
numbr is green, and when the number is odd, the background color is red. Note: 0 is considered as even.
