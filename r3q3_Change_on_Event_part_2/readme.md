# 15 - Change on event part 2

This uses the same concept from the previous question.

However, we have three boxes this time round!

Without changing the HTML or CSS,

1. When the user moves his mouse cursor into a box, it changes to background color red
2. When the user moves his mouse cursor out of a box, it changes to background color white

CHALLENGE
Use only one function to achieve this effort. That is, this one function should work for all three boxes.

See: https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events for a full understanding on how to attach events, and pay attention to the part about the this keyword. The key is to know what is the target of the event (that is, which element has been affected by the event)
